# Movie Recommender System

Welcome to the Movie Recommender System! This application utilizes content-based filtering to recommend movies based on user preferences. It analyzes the attributes of movies such as genre, actors, director, and plot keywords to generate personalized recommendations.

## Application Overview

The Movie Recommender System employs a content-based filtering algorithm to suggest similar movies to users based on their past preferences. It leverages machine learning techniques to analyze movie features and provide accurate recommendations.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn
- NumPy
- Flask

## Machine Learning Knowledge

To build this application, knowledge in the following areas of machine learning was essential:

- **Content-Based Filtering**: Understanding the concept of recommending items based on their attributes rather than user-item interactions.
- **Feature Extraction**: Extracting relevant features from movie data, such as genre, actors, and plot keywords, to represent movies numerically.
- **Similarity Calculation**: Calculating similarity scores between movies using techniques like cosine similarity to identify similar movies.
- **Web Application Development**: Integrating machine learning models into a web application using frameworks like Flask for backend development.
